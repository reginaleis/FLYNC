class Position:
    """
    Represents a position in a text document.

    For objects backed by a YAML file both ``line`` and ``character`` are **1-based**, derived from ruamel.yaml ``start_mark`` / ``end_mark`` by
    adding 1 to the 0-based mark offsets.

    For objects that have no YAML source (e.g. implied or externally loaded objects without a resolved file) both fields are **0**, acting as a
    sentinel meaning *"no location available"*.

    Attributes:
        line (int): 1-based line number, or 0 when no source is available.
        character (int): 1-based character offset, or 0 when no source is available.
